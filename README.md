# Homicide_Analysis
Global Homicide Data Analysis (Python)
This project involved analysing global homicide data from 195 countries, spanning various years and containing details on total homicide counts and rates per 100,000 population. The dataset includes six fields: country, region, subregion, homicide rate, count, and year, which were used to uncover insights into homicide patterns worldwide.
Using Python for data cleaning, processing, and visualization, the project focused on:
•	Key Metrics: Calculated yearly homicide rates and total counts, with year-over-year comparisons to identify shifts in homicide trends over time.
•	Regional and Subregional Insights: Analysed homicide rates by continent and subregion, uncovering areas with notably high or low rates and enabling comparisons across different geographical levels.
•	Customizable Filters: Applied filters for year, region, subregion, and country to allow detailed examination of trends by location and time.
This analysis delivers a comprehensive view of homicide trends globally, providing insights into high-risk areas and supporting data-driven approaches for violence prevention and policy planning.
